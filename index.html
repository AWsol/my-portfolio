                    Hello, World!<br><br>
                    I have a BS in Electrical Engineering from the University of Illinois at Chicago where 
                    I was heavily involved in robotics and held a few leadership roles.<br><br>
                    My career started within telematics as a systems engineer on the onboard monitoring software and systems team. 
                    My primary responsibilities involved translating customer requirements into software requirements,
                    developing and executing test plans, and successfully delivering features that met customer needs.<br><br>
                    After two years I joined the telematics onboard software team as a C++ application software developer
                    which is where I currently reside.<br><br>
                    I have a growth mentality with a passion for discovering new technologies 
                    and building cool things. See my Projects page to see what I've made!<br><br>
                    Here is my outdated <a href="resume.pdf" target="_blank"><i><u>resume</u></i>,</a>
                    if you like that kind of stuff.
